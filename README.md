## Always Color Text
This plugin lets you color specific words and updates it across your Obsidian vault. Just select a word, pick a color, and that word will automatically appear in that color every time you type it, in both editing and reading modes.

This was inspired by the <span style="color: #2d98da">warn</span> <span style="color: #e5a216">deprecated</span> text I’d see in the terminal. I thought it’d be so cool, especially since I often need to repeat a bunch of categorized words!

***You can:***
Assign colors to words or phrases that stay consistent across your vault, right from the right-click menu, command palette or the plugin settings.

Right-click to **Color Once**, **Highlight Once**, or add to the always-colored list. You can either color the text itself or highlight it with a background color.

You can choose your Coloring Style, whether you want to Colour the words or Highlight them across your vault.


Customize your **Own Color Swatches** for faster picking, you can even replace the default swatches.

Toggle Case-Sensitive and ***Partial-Word matching***. For example, if "Art" is colored blue and partial matching is enabled, any word containing "Art" will turn blue, like "Artist" or "Artbook".

There is Blacklisting, which can be added to the Right-click menu for easier access.

Disable coloring for specific files, or toggle **Global Coloring** ON or OFF via the ribbon, status bar, or command palette.

When Global Coloring is off, Texts coloured with "Always Color Text" disappear but one-time colors remain, since they use inline HTML.
    
Use the tiny “Delete All Words” button to clear everything, with a confirmation modal, just to be safe :D
