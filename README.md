## Always Color Text

This plugin lets you color specific words in your Obsidian vault.  
Just select a word, pick a color, and that word will automatically appear in that color every time you type it, in both editing and reading modes.

This was inspired by the <span style="color: #2d98da">warn</span> <span style="color: #e5a216">deprecated</span> text I’d see in the terminal. I thought it’d be so cool, especially since I often need to repeat a bunch of categorized words!

***You can:***

- Assign colors to words or phrases that stay consistent across your vault, right from the right-click menu or the plugin settings.
    
- Right-click to **Color Once**, **Highlight Once**, or add to the always-colored list. You can either color the text itself or highlight it with a background color.
    
- Customize your own color swatches for faster picking, you can even replace the default swatches.
    
- Toggle case-sensitive and partial-word matching. For example, if "Art" is colored blue and partial matching is enabled, any word containing "Art" will turn blue, like "Artist" or "Artbook".
    
- Disable coloring for specific files, or toggle **Global Coloring** on or off via the ribbon, status bar, or command palette.
    
- When Global Coloring is off, persistent colors disappear but one-time colors remain, since they use inline HTML.
    
- Use the “Delete All Words” button to clear everything, with a confirmation modal, just to be safe :D
